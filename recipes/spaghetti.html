        <h1>Spaghetti with Milk</h1>
        <img src="spaghetti.jpg" alt="spaghetti with milk">
        <p>The best way to enjoy this dish is to cook it with fresh milk. Too bad I don't live
            on a farm. I would love to try the recipe with boiled fresh milk. The taste must be
            delightful, especially when the milk is boiled with cinnamon sticks.
            To make the spaghetti recipe</p>
        <p>There are many ways to make Spaghetti with Milk. Some people cook the pasta al dente,
            then finish cooking it in a creamy milk and spice mixture. The spice mixture is
            usually made with cinnamon, anise star, and nutmeg. Let's not forget the salt. Yes,
            salt! When you add a pinch of salt to boiled milk, the taste changes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 cups Milk</li>
            <li>3 Whole Star Anise</li>
            <li>2 Cinnamon Sticks</li>
            <li>Dash of Salt</li>
            <li>1 lb Pasta (Spaghetti, linguini or vermicelli)</li>
            <li>1 Lime Rind</li>
            <li>1/4 Fresh Grated Nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Sugar (more if preferred)</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan Cheese (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large sauce pan over medium high heat, add milk, anise and cinnamon
                and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add salt and pasta, lime rind. Once the milk starts to boil again, reduce
                heat to medium low and let pasta cook for about 25 minutes stirring occasionally
                so it does not stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Add sugar, vanilla and butter and continue to cook until the pasta is fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Remove cinnamon stick and star anise and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
