        <p> Due to the many large cattle ranches in Argentina, meat is
            included in several types of dishes in a variety of ways.
            This criolla beef stew, from Patagonia, Argentina, may be a
            slightly unusual preparation, but it is quite delicious.
            Dried fruits—such as apricots or raisins—along with sweet
            and white potatoes, give the stew a slightly sweet taste,
            while tomatoes and onions, winter squash, and hearty chunks
            of beef round out the complex flavor.</p>
        <p>Carbonada criolla is a wonderful stew, perfect for when the weather
            turns chilly. It is great served with cornbread and a green salad.</p>
